# Abstract
This paper compares YOLOv10 and Florence-2 for detecting and classifying food items in
storage images. The YOLOv10m, YOLOv10x, and Florence-2 base models were ﬁne-tuned on
a dataset of food images with 25 classes. The YOLO models were trained with a batch size
of 16 for 50 epochs, while the Florence-2 model was trained with a batch size of 10 for 10
epochs. This study demonstrates that YOLO models outperform Florence-2 in both speed and
accuracy within the tested conditions. Despite challenges with the Florence-2 model, the re-
sults conﬁrm the feasibility of real-time image detection for classifying food items in complex
environments. Future research should focus on larger datasets and advanced techniques to
improve performance and applicability in practical scenarios.
